ISicily files for inscriptions in the Voci di Pietra exhibition, Catania Museo Civico 2017
These files are the EpiDoc XML files used in I.Sicily (http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/) for the subset of the I.Sicily inscriptions that are currently displayed in the Voci di Pietra exhibition, or directly referenced in that exhibition.
These files are subject to on-going editing. The master files in this repository will be those uploaded and displayed on the main I.Sicily site.
